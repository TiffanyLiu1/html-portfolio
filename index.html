        <h3>University of Utah, College of Engineering</h3>
        <h4>Machine Learning Undergraduate Researcher</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Investigate research of Features Exchange in Federated Learning to improve model learning efficiency with Dr. Mingyue Ji</li>
            <li>With paper will be submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Communications</li>
            <li>In modern communications with large amounts of datasets, the method of aggregating locally-computed updates to learn a shared 
                model in the central cloud has been widely used in federated learning. The previous experiment had presented an approach for
                federated learning by averaging models iteratively to improve learning efficiency. However, communication costs are the 
                principal constraint that needs to be reduced as much as possible. The conventional approach requires to share all variables 
                of the entire model between user devices, in which minimization of communication cost is restricted. Thus, instead of sharing 
                all weight variables in neural network iteratively, we advocate an alternative approach for federated learning to learn model 
                by only exchanging part of the hidden output variables midway through the iteration. We term this approach Features Exchange, 
                which can decrease communication costs by reducing the number of exchanged datasets.</li>
            <li>The research presents a practical approach for federated learning in neural networks to improve the model learning efficiency 
                with low communication costs. This approach is based on each client sharing a set of averaged hidden output variables of one 
                of the hidden layers between each other when halfway through the local training iteration. During the optimization process, 
                each client considers the features that are obtained from other clients to improve training outcomes and generalize the model. 
                The experiment evaluates the model by considering three different datasets and two training structures with comparisons of three 
                cases in different training approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that the Features Exchange approach is feasible in 
                biased datasets. The outcomes increase accuracy by 5% as compared to the model averaging approach, while the Features Exchange 
                approach decreased 50% communication costs by reducing number of exchanged parameters among clients in system</li>
